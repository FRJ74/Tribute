          <p>Chief Joseph organized a retreat to protect his people. He led 600 Nez Perce 1,400 miles toward the Canadian border. He fought and won against the US army in several battles along the journey over the summer of 1877. However, cornered by US troops, facing an upcoming winter with no food and no supplies, Chief Joseph worried that his people would not survive. Chief Joseph then surrendered, saying, “I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever.” The tribe was sent to a reservation in Oklahoma.</p>
